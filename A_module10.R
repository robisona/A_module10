# (1)	We completed a model comparison for the plant height data in class, but did not have  the full set of all
# possible covariate combinations (one, two, and three predictor models).  Using the predictors basal.diam,
# treatment.sp, and bioassay.sp, construct the remaining linear models with height as the response (no 
# interactions terms) and find the best fit model among all models (including those constructed in class). 
# Interpret the results of your best fit model and be sure to check model assumptions.


# Run 7 regression models for each explanatory variables (n = 3), each combination of 2 explanatory variables
# (n = 3), and one that includes all three explanatory variables (n = 1). For the categorical variables
# (treatment.sp and bioassay.sp), must use 'factor'.
m1.basal <- lm(height ~ basal.diam, data = Data)
m2.treat <- lm(height ~ factor(treatment.sp), data = Data)
m3.bioas <- lm(height ~ factor(bioassay.sp), data = Data)
m4.bas.tre <- lm(height ~ basal.diam + factor(treatment.sp), data = Data)
m5.bas.bio <- lm(height ~ basal.diam + factor(bioassay.sp), data = Data)
m6.tre.bio <- lm(height ~ factor(treatment.sp) + factor(bioassay.sp), data = Data)
m7.bas.tre.bio <- lm(height ~ basal.diam + factor(treatment.sp) + factor(bioassay.sp), data = Data)


# Use the AIG to determine which model provides the best fit. First find the AIC of the seven models, then 
# determine the index of the minimum AIC, which indicates the best model fit while taking into account the
# number of explanatory variables.
aic = AIC(m1.basal, m1.treat, m1.bioas, m2.bas.tre, m2.bas.bio, m2.tre.bio, m3.bas.tre.bio)
best.m.num <- which.min(aic$AIC)
best.m.num
min.AIC <- min(aic$AIC)
min.AIC
# The best fit model is the one which includes all three explanatory variables (m7.bas.tre.bio). The AIC values
# for this model is 902.7335.


# Evaluate the results of our best fit model.
# Rename model for ease of use
m7 <- m7.bas.tre.bio


# Summarize model output and examine calculated coefficients
m7.output <- summary(m7)
m7.output$coefficients
# The regression equation follows, with coefficients rounded to 3 significant digits:
# height = 17.1 + 3.93*basal.dim + 2.14(if treatment.sp = Frangula) - 
#       7.23(if bioassay.sp = Spirea) - 16.1(if bioassay.sp = Viburnum)
# All coefficients are significant as well, with p < 0.001 for all except the treatment.sp factor, in which
# p = 0.02.

# Examine r2 fit
m7.output$r.squared
# r2 = 0.66, indicating fairly strong model fit


# Evaluate the normality of residuals using a histogram
hist(m7$residuals)
# Plot reveals apparent normal distribution


# Evaluate the normality of residuals using a normal Q-Q plot
plot(m7, which = 2)
# Points fall along 1-1 line quite well


# Evaluate the homogeneity of residuals
plot(m7, which = 1)
# Distribution is fairly even across fitted values


# Evaluate if any points have abnormally strong leverage on the model fit
plot(m7, which = 4)
#A few points stand out above the rest, but not unreasonably

# (2)	Using model diagnostics for your best fit model in Question 1, identify potential outliers in your 
# best fit model. Explore the effect of these observations on your results by removing potential outliers 
# from your analysis and comparing the output to the best fit model that includes all observations.  Do 
# any of the potential outliers qualitatively affect the model results?  In other words, would you come to
# a different conclusion about the effect of the predictors on height if you removed the outliers?

# Examine results for outliers
# First, evaluate the normality of residuals using a normal Q-Q plot
plot(m7, which = 2)
# Points 13, 73, and 76 are the largest outliers 


# Next, evaluate the homogeneity of residuals
plot(m7, which = 1)
# Points 13, 73, and 76 are the largest outliers again


# Evaluate if any points have abnormally strong leverage on the model fit
plot(m7, which = 4)
# Points 13, 38, and 39 have the most leverage on the model fit


# Let's remove all of these observations from the data set and re-run the model fit
Rows <- c(13, 38, 39, 73, 76)
Data.sel <- Data[-Rows,]


# Now we can run a linear model again with this subset data
m7.sel <- lm(height ~ basal.diam + factor(treatment.sp) + factor(bioassay.sp), data = Data.sel)

# Compare model fits using AIC
aic.2 = AIC(m7, m7.sel)
best.m.num <- which.min(aic.2$AIC)
best.m.num
# The model fit is imporved by removing outliers. The AIC improves from approximately 903 to 826.


# Summarize model output and examine calculated coefficients
m7.sel.output <- summary(m7.sel)
m7.sel.output$coefficients
# The regression equation follows, with coefficients rounded to 3 significant digits:
# height = 19.9 + 3.35*basal.dim + 1.96(if treatment.sp = Frangula) - 
#       8.81(if bioassay.sp = Spirea) - 17.1(if bioassay.sp = Viburnum)
# All coefficients are significant as well, with p < 0.001 for all except the treatment.sp factor, in which
# p = 0.01.
# However, the magnitude of coefficients is not very largely different from those of the linear model with
# outliers still in place.

# Examine r2 fit
m7.sel.output$r.squared
# The r2 improces to 0.74 (from 0.66)

# (3)	We might expect that the number of flowers and fruit produced would have similar drivers.  Use model 
# comparison to find the best fit model to explain the number of fruit and the number of flowers produced. 
# Restrict your covariate set to basal diameter and treatment organ and do not include interaction terms.  
# Do the same covariates best explain both flower and fruit production?  What best explains flower 
# production?  What best explains fruit production? Do your models explain fruit and flower prediction well?  
  

# Since the flower and fruit is count data, we can use a Poisson distribution. So we can run a model for
# flower numbers with basal diamter, treatment organism, or both as explanatory variables, remembering that
# treatment organism is a categorical variable. We save the summary of each model for use later in comparing
# models.

mp.fru.AIC
# The best model for the number of flowers uses only the treatment organism (AIC = 67.7)

# Apply a chi-squared test to the deviance residuals to get an estimate 'goodness of fit'
print(p.chisq <- pchisq(m5p.fru.tre$deviance, m5p.fru.tre$df.residual, lower.tail=FALSE))
# Because this results in a value = 1, we can say the model has a good fit. However, if we inspect the data
# further, we can see that there is fruit on only one sample. 
# If we sum all the rows with values greater than 0, it will return the number of samples with fruit
sum(Data$fruit.num > 0)
# We get only one sample. So we should be wary of developing a model with one positive result in 144 samples.
# We can view this overwhelming leverage of a single point in the following plot:
plot(m5p.fru.tre, which = 4)
